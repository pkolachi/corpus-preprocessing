PORTING from Python 2 to Python 3
== checked scripts:
    cmpDirectories.py
    stanforddependencyconverter.py
    alt_unigoogle_utils.py

== exceptions:
    alt_unigoogle_utils.py (does not work in Python3, writing to file has to be fixed and lambda functions are not picklable- so threads mode fails)


NOW added globalimports.py - this should be kept uniform to let all 
scripts use these basic imports; 
ONLY basic imports should be put in this file- basic imports to mainly ensure that
codes are compatible with both 2 and 3 and
to avoid any resistance to use more flexible but obscure facilities in Python
(for example, defaultdict is a good example).


=======================

Generic scripts: 
    re-use functions in random_utils to ensure uniformity across processing scripts;
    re-use functions in parallelize_utils to ensure uniformity across multiprocessing scripts;
	check if putting and taking things in queues is an acceptable overhead (compared to using pools)
    apparently, using generators across threads raises Valueerror: generator already in execution. So, the current parallelize_utils does not work. Fix this. 

stanford_corenlp_utils.py


add syntactic category information to prune entries in phrase-table; compute normalized prob scores from weights in tuned model; 
term indexing; - building trie structure for n-best trees
Add argparse utility to allow for command-line arguments. Current available facilities are
